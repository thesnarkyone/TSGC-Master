Uncle Jack's Post Cards  

One of the more pedestrian stories we told about Uncle Jack was about his collection of post cards. These turned out to be incredibly important in our investigations. Everyone thought they were simply cards he had kept as they were sent to him by friends. But in fact, they were much more significant. We had heard about Ucle Jack's trunk of post cards for years, but never quite believed it. Then, last October, we had tracked down some of Uncle Jack's effects to a second cousin in Alabama. When we arrived, Cousin Lou gave us a trunk the size of a foot locker. IN addition to other papers and souvenirs of his travels, the trunk contained several card boxes filled with post cards. We were stunned.

Since he was a young man and first shipped as a deck hand aboard a steamer, Uncle Jack was in the habit of sending himself post cards. When ever he entered a new town, if there was postal servaice available, he would jot a few observations and send a post card to him home address. He noted the date, the weather, where he had come from, and any interesting occurence.

Back home and able to examine the boxes and cards more closely, it seemed our stalling investigations had just gotten a shot in the arm. Each of the 8 boxes was labeled with a date range of the card within. And each box held several hundred cards.

The early cards were simple. For example, _Morocco Arrived today, April 3 1893. Dined with Capt. Hargrave & fam. Explored ruins outside of town. Booked passage to Cairo._

As Uncle Jack got older, he started writing his messages in a cipher. It was not a complicated one, meant primarily to keep curious eyes from accidentally reading his unconventional journ al. He used a book cipher that replaced wach letter with a number. They Key was the King James Bible. The cipher starting point was indicated by the date. The month was the Book, the day was the chapter, and the date was the verse. For example, Friday March 16 was Leviticus 5:16. He had his own method of assigning the month to the book, but once we figured it out -- and there were clues once we knew what to look for -- it was not hard.

As we began to decipher the cards we cross referenced the places and dates with suspected KGR activity. They almost always matched up and the messages gave us some additional lead to discover more about the case. One could make the case that Uncle Jack's post card collection -- sorted, ciphered, and hidden for many years -- _is_ The Southern Gothic Codex.
